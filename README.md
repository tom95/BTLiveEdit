# BTLiveEdit

Proof-of-concept for a Live-tracking System inside Squeak/Smalltalk.

## Current Status
Most essential features are implemented. The current code base, however,
will likely cause problems when used in arbitrary projects, unless the
live-edit session is very well configured (correct immutability settings
and annotations).
